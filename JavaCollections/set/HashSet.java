public class HashSet<S> {
//    The HashSet class implements the Set interface.
//    In a HashSet, the order of the elements may not be the same as the order of insertion.
//    When an element is added into the HashSet a HashCode is calculated and the element is added to the appropriate bucket ( a bucket is a slot in any Hash structure ).
//    A good HashSet algorithm will uniformly distribute the elements so that the time performance of the structure remains constant. A constant-time performance means it takes constant time for basic operations like insert, deletes, and search.
