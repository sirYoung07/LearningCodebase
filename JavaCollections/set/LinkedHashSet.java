public class LinkedHashSet {
//    LinkedHashSet implements the Set interface. The LinkedHashSet is very similar to the HashSet with the difference being that for every bucket the structure uses to store elements is a doubly-linked list. The LinkedHashSet ordering is better compared to HashSet without any additional costs.

//    Let us take an example to understand HashSet and LinkedHashSet.
//    In the code given below, we instantiate a HashSet named strHashSet, using add() method add elements to the HashSet.
//    The hasNext() method and next() method are methods of the Iterable interface that are used to check if there is the next element and to retrieve the next element respectively in any Collection. Using the constructor of the LinkedHashSet, all of the elements of the HashSet are added to it.
//    An Iterator is created to traverse through it and using it the elements are printed on the console.
