//    The Map interface is a structure that maps a key to every value.
//    A Map does not allow duplicate elements as one key cannot have multiple mappings.
//    A Map has three different views, a Set view of the keys, a Set view of key-value mappings, and a Collection view of the values.
//    The methods of the Map interface are given below, every class that implements Map must provide definitions for these methods.
