public class HashMapAndHashTable {
//    9. a) HashMap
//    The HashMap class implements the Map interface.
//    For every entry in a HashMap, a hashCode is computed and this entry is inserted into the bucket with the hashCode value as its index.
//    Every entry is a key-value pair. A bucket in a HashMap may contain more than one entry.
//    A good HashMap algorithm will try to uniformly distribute the elements in the HashMap.
//    HashMap has constant time performance for basic retrieval, insertion, deletion, and manipulation operations.
//    The two most important factors that affect the performance of a HashMap are initial capacity and load factor.
//    The number of buckets is the capacity and the measure of when to increase this capacity is load factor.
//    The HashMap is faster compared to a HashTable.
//
//    Syntax:
//    HashMap<? , ?> hashMapName = new HashMap<? , ?>();
//
//
//9. b) Hashtable
//    The Hashtable class implements the Map interface.
//    The Hashtable has key-value pairs as its elements.
//    For effective implementation of the hashtable, the keys must be unique.
//    A Hashtable is very similar to a Hashtable, but Hashtable is synchronous.
//    A good Hashtable algorithm will try to uniformly distribute the elements in the Hashtable.
//    Hashtable has constant time performance for basic retrieval, insertion, deletion, and manipulation operations.
//    The two most important factors that affect the performance of a Hashtable are initial capacity and load factor.
//    The number of buckets is the capacity and the measure of when to increase this capacity is load factor.

//    9. c) LinkedHashMap
//    The LinkedHashMap class implements the Map interface.
//    A LinkedHashMap is a hash map linked list implementation of a map.
//    Every entry in the LinkedHashMap has a doubly-linked list running through it.
//    This linked list defines the iteration order that is the order of the keys inserted into the LinkedHashMap.
//    Like all implementations of Map, the elements of the LinkedHashMap are key-value pairs.
