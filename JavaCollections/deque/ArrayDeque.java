package JavaCollections.deque;

public class ArrayDeque {
//    The ArrayDeque class implements the Deque interface. ArrayDeque is a re-sizable implementation of Deque,
//    it has no fixed capacity but increases as required.
//    The ArrayDeque can be used as a stack, and it is faster compared to the Stack class.
//    ArrayDeque is not thread-safe and it does not allow concurrent access by different threads.
